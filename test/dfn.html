  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>Forward references to dfn work.</p>
  <p>Also terms from ES6 are auto-linked: Lexical Environment, Completion, etc.</p>

<emu-clause id="sec-dfn">
  <h1>dfn</h1>

  <p>The term <dfn>dfn</dfn> means the dfn tag. Other mentions of dfn in this clause should be auto-linked as of v2.8.2.</p>

  <p>The term <dfn id="dfn2">dfn2</dfn> should have any links go directly to it.</p>

  <emu-clause id="sec-dfn-subclause">
    <h1>dfn subclause</h1>

    <p>dfn should be auto-linked here as well. The linking of dfn is case sensitive. But the header shouldn't auto-link.</p>
  </emu-clause>

  <p>Also terms are auto-linked in algorithms. But not naked abstract ops!</p>

  <!-- these should autolink even though they are under the same clause that defines the dfn -->
  <emu-alg>
    1. Call the dfn algorithm.
    2. Do something great with dfn.
    3. dfn is now awesome.
    4. dfn2 goes to the ID directly.
  </emu-alg>

  <emu-clause id="sec-dfn-autolink">
    <h1>dfn autolink</h1>

    <!-- these should autolink -->
    <emu-alg>
      1. Call the dfn algorithm.
      2. Do something great with dfn.
      3. dfn is now awesome.
      4. dfn2 goes to the ID directly.
    </emu-alg>
  </emu-clause>
</emu-clause>

<p>dfn is not auto-linked outside of clauses. Nor are terms created, such as <dfn>linking</dfn>.</p>
