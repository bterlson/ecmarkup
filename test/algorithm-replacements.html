  <h1>Title</h1>

  <p>You can refer to a step in a replacement algorithm before it occurs in text, like step <emu-xref href="#step-example"></emu-xref>.</p>

  <p>You can similarly refer to a step in a replacement algorithm which itself which replaces a step in a replacement algorithm, like step <emu-xref href="#step-nested-example"></emu-xref>.</p>

  <p>An algorithm can come before the step it replaces.</p>

  <emu-alg replaces-step="to-be-replaced">
    1. Two a:
      1. Two a i:
        1. Two a i one.
        1. [label="example"] Two a i two.
  </emu-alg>

  <p>This is our sample algorithm.</p>
  <emu-alg>
    1. One.
    1. Two:
      1. [label="to-be-replaced"] Two a.
  </emu-alg>

  <p>An algorithm can also come after the step it replaces.</p>

  <emu-alg replaces-step="to-be-replaced">
    1. Two a:
      1. Two a i:
        1. Two a i one.
        1. [label="example"] Two a i two.
  </emu-alg>

  <p>You can even replace steps in replacement algorithms.</p>

  <emu-alg replaces-step="example">
    1. Two a i two:
      1. Two a i two a.
      1. Two a i two b.
      1. [label="nested-example"] Two a i two c:
        1. Two a i two c i:
          1. Two a i two c i i:
            1. Two a i two c i i i.
            1. Two a i two c i i ii.
  </emu-alg>
</emu-clause>
