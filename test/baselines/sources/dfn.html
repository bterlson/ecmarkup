  <h1>Intro</h1>
  <p>Forward references to dfn work.</p>
  <p>Also terms from ES6 are auto-linked: Lexical Environment, Completion, etc.</p>
</emu-intro>
<emu-clause id="sec-dfn">
  <h1>dfn</h1>

  <p>The term <dfn>dfn</dfn> means the dfn tag. Other mentions of dfn in this clause should not be auto-linked.</p>

  <p>Terms with ids are called <dfn id="identifiers">id dfns</dfn>. Since this dfn has an id, other occurences
  of id dfns may autolink.</p>

  <emu-clause id="sec-dfn-subclause">
    <h1>dfn subclause</h1>

    <p>Dfn should be auto-linked here as well. The linking of dfn is case insensitive. But the header shouldn't auto-link.</p>
    <p>Id dfns should link to #identifiers.</p>
  </emu-clause>

  <p>Also terms are auto-linked in algorithms. But not naked abstract ops!</p>

  <!-- these should autolink - while they are under the same clause that defines the dfn, algs want auto-linking always -->
  <emu-alg>
    1. Call the dfn algorithm.
    2. Do something great with dfn.
    3. dfn is now awesome.
